## HOOBS Security

We take security very seriously at HOOBS. We welcome any peer review of our 100% open source code to ensure nobody's HOOBS system is ever compromised or hacked.

### Where should I report security issues?

In order to give the community time to respond and upgrade we strongly urge you report all security issues privately. Please email us directly at `dev@hoobs.org` with details and reproduction steps and we will respond ASAP. Security issues *always* take precedence over bug fixes and feature work. We can and do mark releases as "urgent" if they contain serious security fixes.
